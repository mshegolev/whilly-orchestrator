"""Postgres-backed task repository for Whilly v4.0 (PRD FR-1.3, FR-1.4, FR-2.1, FR-2.3, FR-2.4).

This module owns the SQL that mutates the ``tasks`` table and writes audit
rows to ``events``. It is the single I/O-side counterpart to the pure
state-machine in :mod:`whilly.core.state_machine`: callers operating against
Postgres go through :class:`TaskRepository` instead of issuing SQL directly,
so the at-least-once / atomicity invariants live in one place.

Scope of TASK-009b / TASK-009c / TASK-009d
------------------------------------------
TASK-009b implemented :meth:`TaskRepository.claim_task` — atomic
``PENDING`` → ``CLAIMED`` transition via ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``
plus a CLAIM event in one transaction.

TASK-009c added :meth:`TaskRepository.complete_task` and
:meth:`TaskRepository.fail_task` with optimistic locking on the
``tasks.version`` counter (PRD FR-2.4). Both methods filter the UPDATE by
``WHERE id = $1 AND version = $2 AND status IN (...)`` — no row locks are
taken, so two concurrent completers race purely through the version
counter: one wins, the other gets 0 rows affected and we surface a
:class:`VersionConflictError` after a follow-up SELECT to differentiate
"someone moved past me" from "task gone" (FK cascade) and "wrong status".

TASK-009d (this commit) adds :meth:`TaskRepository.release_stale_tasks` —
the visibility-timeout sweep (PRD FR-1.4). It scans for ``CLAIMED`` or
``IN_PROGRESS`` rows whose ``claimed_at`` predates ``NOW() - interval``,
flips them back to ``PENDING`` (clearing ``claimed_by`` / ``claimed_at``,
incrementing ``version``), and inserts a ``RELEASE`` event per row with
``payload = {"reason": "visibility_timeout", "version": <new>}``. All
mutations happen in a single ``WITH released AS (UPDATE ... RETURNING ...)
INSERT INTO events ...`` round-trip so the audit log can never disagree
with the tasks table — same atomicity contract as the per-row methods,
batched.

Why ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` for ``claim_task`` but **not** for
complete/fail?
    Claim is multi-row contention: many workers compete for the queue head,
    so we must atomically pick *one* row from the available pool. SKIP
    LOCKED is the right primitive there. Complete / fail target a single,
    already-owned task — there's no pool to scan, just one row to flip.
    Optimistic locking via ``version`` lets us detect lost updates (e.g.
    visibility-timeout sweep released the task to a second worker that
    already started running it) without taking row locks, which is cheaper
    and avoids holding lockers while we write the audit event.

Why a CTE + outer UPDATE for claim?
    The CTE materialises the lock decision (``SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1``) and the
    outer ``UPDATE ... FROM picked`` re-uses that same row lock to flip
    status / claimed_by / claimed_at / version in one statement. We could
    SELECT first and UPDATE second from Python, but that opens a window
    between the lock and the write where the connection could be lost — the
    single SQL keeps the operation atomic at the wire level too.

asyncpg + JSONB
    asyncpg returns JSONB columns as raw ``str`` (JSON text) by default.
    Rather than monkey-patching codecs onto the pool (TASK-009a's territory)
    we ``json.loads`` the array columns inside :func:`_row_to_task`. The
    helper also accepts already-decoded ``list``/``dict`` so a future codec
    registration in pool.py won't break us.

        can distinguish:

        * **lost update** — another writer (visibility-timeout sweep, second
          worker after a re-claim) advanced the version first;
        * **wrong status** — the task is already DONE / FAILED / SKIPPED
          (idempotent retry detection);
        * **task missing** — the row vanished (FK cascade in tests).

        See :class:`VersionConflictError` for the field semantics.

        Why no SELECT-then-UPDATE here?
            We deliberately skip ``FOR UPDATE`` and the read-modify-write
            ceremony: filtering by ``version`` in the UPDATE is the lock-free
            equivalent and avoids holding a row lock while we write the
            audit event. The follow-up ``_PROBE_TASK_SQL`` only runs on the
            cold "0 rows updated" path, so the happy path is one round-trip.

        Concurrency contract (PRD FR-2.4)
        ---------------------------------
        Mirrors :meth:`complete_task`: the UPDATE filters by both
        ``version`` and ``status``, RETURNING ships the post-update row,
        and a 0-row result triggers :class:`VersionConflictError` after a
        single follow-up SELECT to classify the cause:

        * **lost update** — the visibility-timeout sweep released the row
          first; ``actual_version`` is one ahead and ``actual_status`` is
          ``PENDING``. The worker should treat this as "already released,
          nothing to do" and exit.
        * **wrong status** — the worker already finished / failed the task
          before the signal handler reached this method (extremely
          narrow race; not impossible). The terminal status wins.
        * **task missing** — FK cascade in tests; same as the other
          methods.

        Args
        ----
        task_id:
            The task to release. Must currently be ``CLAIMED`` or
            ``IN_PROGRESS`` for the UPDATE to match.
        version:
            Caller's last-seen version (typically the value returned by
            ``start_task`` / ``claim_task``). Used for optimistic locking.
        reason:
            Human-readable cause for the release. Persisted into the
            ``RELEASE`` event payload — distinguishes
            ``"shutdown"`` (this method) from ``"visibility_timeout"``

        Returns
        -------
        Task
            The post-update task with ``status = PENDING``,
            ``version`` incremented.

        Raises
        ------

        Implements the visibility-timeout sweep (PRD FR-1.4): any row whose

        flipped back to ``PENDING`` with ``claimed_by`` / ``claimed_at``
        cleared, ``version`` incremented, and a ``RELEASE`` event row
        appended carrying ``payload = {"reason": "visibility_timeout",
        "version": <new>}``. Returns the number of rows released so the
        background-task loop in TASK-025 can log / surface metrics.

        Single round-trip: the UPDATE and the audit-event INSERT run as one
        SQL statement (CTE + ``INSERT ... SELECT FROM released``). That's
        important because the sweep operates on a *batch* of rows — looping
        in Python would either need a transaction-wide lock (slow) or expose
        a window where some rows are PENDING again but their RELEASE event
        hasn't been written yet (audit drift).

        Concurrency with active workers (PRD FR-2.4)
        --------------------------------------------
        The sweep does *not* take row locks (no ``FOR UPDATE``). It races
        against worker mutations through the optimistic-locking lattice:

        * If a worker's ``complete_task`` / ``fail_task`` commits first, the
          row is no longer ``CLAIMED`` / ``IN_PROGRESS`` and our status
          filter excludes it — the sweep silently skips it. This is the
          desired outcome: the worker finished in time, no release needed.
        * If the sweep commits first, the worker's UPDATE matches zero rows
          (status flipped from ``IN_PROGRESS`` to ``PENDING``, version
          advanced) and surfaces :class:`VersionConflictError` —
          differentiated as "wrong status" via the probe, so the worker can
          drop the result and re-claim cleanly.

        Either way exactly one of the two writers wins; there is no path
        where both succeed and produce a duplicate / inconsistent state.

        Args:
            visibility_timeout_seconds: Age threshold in seconds. Rows with
                ``claimed_at < NOW() - this`` are released. Must be a
                non-negative integer; ``0`` releases every active claim
                (useful in tests with controlled clocks).

        Returns:
            Number of rows released (and corresponding RELEASE events
            written). ``0`` is the normal "nothing stale" outcome, not an
            error.
